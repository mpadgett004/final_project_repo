0,"SOBER REVIEW OF DOGECOIN - 02/04/2021

Hi Shibes!

I think it's a good idea to take a step back and see what we have accomplished within the last WEEK rather than trying to group buy and get all bent out of shape when things don't become the outcome you want.

First of all, before making an investment, you need to play jury in the sense you need to gather all the facts and weigh the bear and the bull case. I am a firm believer the bull case outweighs the bear case and you can do your own research on this, but if having the richest man in the world on your side doesn't tell you something, than I don't know what does.

Don't group buy because of hype, buy Doge because you believe in it for a better future. I am a believer in Doge and I have been since 2014. This coin is fun with groundbreaking new technology with the capability of changing payment methods as we know it, it's growing at a pace I never thought would be imaginable and we are only getting started. Being in wild swings in the beginning to todays current events, I never thought we would be steady around 4 - 5 cents. That is truly remarkable. On a side note, if you are looking to make profit, maybe consider day trading if you are confident in your abilities. If not, buy and hold Dogecoin. It is not going anywhere and with the recent community gain and the backing of Elon Musk and new businesses accepting as a payment method, this may dip short term, but in the long run it will only go up.

**Some Great Facts:**

\-Dogecoin is up around 30% today as I am typing this, over 400% for the month.  
\-Dogecoin has a market cap of around 6 billion USD, placing us at #11, not taking into account Tether or USDC  
\-A billionare out in the world with an anonymous address owns 34B doge and has been holding and accumulating for a long time. [https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L)  
\-Our Dogecoin Subreddit has gained 700k if not more new members in the past week (WELCOME NEW SHIBES SO WOW, VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU!)  
\-Elon Musk loves Dogecoin and Mark Cuban has mentioned us and we are getting media coverage everywhere and some very awesome shibes have taken it upon themselves to purchase billboards to spread the message  
\-Dogecoin is the number one most mentioned thing on Twitter in history

Look, if these facts do not excite you, than maybe you should consider a change in your mindset and approach to Dogecoin. Maybe you bought in high. I am a believer over time this will find new highs, higher than 8 cents. Maybe coinbase will start working with Dogecoin. Maybe Elon will drop some crazy news. The possibilities are endless. That would all be wonderful and barrier to entry with legit coins would be so much better than just buying with Robinhood which so many people are doing and  
I believe defeats the whole purpose of remaining anonymous and decentralized, given the recent events with Robinhood.

Furthermore, take care of yourselves. Being glued to the screen watching all the dips and freaking out over losing a number on a screen is not worth the stress. Save yourself alot of heartache, buy and hold, work hard, take care of yourself, drink plenty of water, really just do you.

If we can accomplish all this within one week, where are we going to be in 1 month? 6 months? 1 year? The future looks incredibly bright for Dogecoin and well, HODL and buckle up, because it may be bumpy, but it's going to be one hell of a ride!",t3_lcyyee,1612498664.0,2021-02-05 04:17:44,0.9988,0.041,0.779,0.179,Positive
1,"Like I said in the other daily thread, we need to stop scheduling pump times. All it does is tell the Whales when we're planning to buy more Doge, and lets them plan their dumps more easily, which always causes a panic, which always drives prices lower. I don't think a single planned pump has been successful on this sub over the last week and every one of them has ended (in the last case, it started) in a massive drop in price.

Don't use Dogecoin to make a quick buck unless you are really good at reading the highs and lows. I'm holding my 60,000 Doge to Alpha Centauri and beyond. I suggest others do the same and realize that the price will hit $0.10  in the next few weeks/months. It will happen. If you absolutely have to, just set a sell limit of 10 cents and walk away for a few months. Your broker will send you an email when it sells. Yeah, you might miss out if the price goes a little higher, but you won't be panic selling or getting frustrated at the price not going anywhere. There is momentum on our side, but unless Elon Musk is literally holding our hands with his tweets, it is not happening in a day.",t3_lcyyee,1612499290.0,2021-02-05 04:28:10,-0.2033,0.069,0.873,0.057,Negative

5,"I really wish that this sub was more moderated. At the moment, due to the large influx of novices to the crypto ecosystem, we're seeing a lot of misinformation being flung left and right. Individuals who don't realize the dynamics of investment, (most notably the pump and dumps we keep seeing repeatedly) are parroting the ""buy at X time"" or ""to the moon tonight"" rhetoric that feeds the whale behaviour and only furthers the losses for those very same novice investors. Even if bots and the aforementioned whales are the precursors for this kind of behaviour, it's important to restrict the spread from people who don't realize they're being taken advantage of and are in turn helping somebody else take advantage of others.

While I'm disappointed that so many people are quick to sell at a loss, this is the nature of this sort of increase in value. What I don't want to see is the decline of Doge as people associate repeated loss with this crypto because of the constant pump and dumps that this sub incentivizes. Getting information out there, PR in general, is always good, but if people come and see nothing but actual children screaming at others to participate in a pump and dump while they themselves lose their investment (even if it is only a few dollars) we will only scare investors away from securing Doge as a real world use crypto.",t3_lcyyee,1612498229.0,2021-02-05 04:10:29,-0.9373,0.12,0.818,0.062,Negative

8,"UNDERSTANDING PUMP AND DUMP AND THE BENEFIT OF HOLD 

Doge is gathering attention on bill boards in the Time Square!!!


Ok, let me first put down a disclaimer. I have just been in this crypto market for half a year so i am still a newbie compare to all of you right here. But i have recognized a lack of understanding of the fundamental from new player and that is why i think it is very important that we clear some of the questio  that many people have and nobody tell them. Please correct me if i am wrong, i have no financial back ground and everything i say, i learnt the hard way

1: so yesterday for Doge was a normal day, we recover from the previous dip until Elon musk tweet and back Doge, it resulted in a sharp increase of over 50% in a couple of hours. After that surge, things cool down and imediately there was people spreading news about a new pump at 9EST. Now why?
A) they spread this news because every NEW player are excited. Super excited. Money over night. Put 5k in, walk out 6k. That is lovely.
B) you have to ask yourself why people will schedule a pump and telling you which coin it is and what time it is.  If you check the time frame, doge before the spread of the pump news is already 0.05 which is high compare to its floor price before. Now yall excited. People start buying in and drive the price up. 

But think about the whales, if they really want to pump a coin, why would they tell you before hand. The coin goes up, which means that they wont make as much money from their own pump. Right? So something is wrong. Fundementally and pscychologically.

Now when it is 9 est, the price imediately drop. Because new player was told to buy, the price didnt drop down as fast, leaving time for whales to sell their coins with good price. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART: some new player panic, sell all their coins to cut cost. The price drop even more. Now whales then buy back coins at dirt cheap price and started to wage for another pump in a few days.

2) so what can we do? Why everybody said hold? Or buy the dip. It is rather logical isnt it? Let say there is 10 doge coin available. There is one whale and 2 holders and 3 newbie. Each holder got 1 coin, the whale got 4 and the rest on the market. 

The newbie buy all the coin in at high price, hoping the price go up. But the whale dump all their coin, so the price goes wayyyy down. Now if you are new, ya panic, ya sell all your coin. The price goes down harder. Now the whale buy 5 coins back. They now hold 5 but pay equal to 3 coins with price before the dump. 

What if yoy hold? Well its logiv right, if you hold, there wont be alot more coins on the market. If you and the holder both hold, now there is only 5 coins on the market. Less supply means: better price. So even if the price actually dip, when it stop dipping it will have a higher floor than the last time before this whole trading scenario. 

What next? Well the next pump right. So if you think about it, if everytime it pump you hold, you benfit from the pump. Think about the folks that has hold through 20 pumps like this. I bet you they already gain alot.

I hope everybody learn something from this, particularly newbie. If you have a strong community of holders, then it is not a bad things to hold. Besides, if you invested everything in a coin and complain that you have lost everything then it is you fault first. Blame yourself first, but then think about the whole thing and what can you learn. Ya gonna benefit from it.

Do not panic when the price starts dipping. Fluctuations are normal. A few hours ago it was 0.054, now it's back to 0.046.

THAT'S OKAY.

That's just how it works. It fluctuates. Coin price does not go 100% overnight. It will take weeks, months, and in some cases years. The important part is you ***hodl.*** *Do not panic.* Buy when it dips, keep holding until the price gets right. Some businesses are now starting to adapt DOGE. Pay with DOGE, buy more DOGE. Keeping DOGE in circulation gives it more value. Just DON'T PANIC if the price drops.

18,"I would be lying if I said I didn't hope to earn some money through Doge eventually, but for now I would really just be happy if it could get steady growth with a few percent every day so that the movement can grow healthily instead of this pump and dump nonsense with over 50% changes everyday.

And your posts are exactly what I think is needed to achieve this. Informing the people, not giving wrong expectations, while keeping the doge community alive. If this community now gets more members who help to steadily let it grow, informed and guided by posts like yours, that would be perfect and maybe not so unrealistic, since Dogecoin did get a lot of media attention through the hype. Now we just have to get people to help us in this quest (though of course we shouldn't force people or pressure into or anything like that)

Even tho the price fell drastically after the dump last night, the lowest it went to was about 0.041. To reiterate that, the LOWEST it went to was 4x HIGHER than the beginning of the year.

Look at the dogecoin charts for the past couple years even. You see a sudden spike (caused by some hype train, tweet, or meme), followed by a drop, then it ends with a raised floor.

27,"SIMPLE TRADE STRATEGY!!

I'll start by saying I am not a professional trader, just someone with a little experience who has made a tonne of mistakes.

ONLY USE WHAT YOU CAN COMFORTABLY LOSE!! IT'S BETTER TO MAKE SOME THAN TO LOSE IT ALL!!

Let's kick this off with an example of a $1,000 account (adjust for your own account)

What I would do is play 2 positions.

Position 1. using 10% ($100) of the total value of your account, play a long position. In other words, let it run. This position should be left regardless of the market fluctuations. Your aim here is to make profits down the track if prices rise significantly.

Position 2. Using 15% ($150) of your entire account. This position you will want to play the dips. Start by waiting for a low and then buy in and wait for an uplift. Your aim here is to set limits a little higher than your buy in, about 1-2cents. Once this limit is filled you can then take your profits and wait for the next dip. This will work better if you research the basics of day trading and start using charts.

As you take profit and your account grows, so will your position. Say you made a profit of $500 and now your account has risen to $1,500. You can now place an order for a 15% position on $1,500. Think of it as a snow ball rolling down a hill, constantly gaining momentum and snow, your account should do the same.

Stops can be placed below the last major dip or wherever you feel comfortable. You don't want to lose everything in case the market crashes.

You are only playing 2 positions which will leave you with a 75% buffer on your account to help weather the lows whilst you are waiting for the uplift.

Greed is a tough beast to tame for all of us. Gambling (because that is what this is) is a risky game, so you want to make sure you have the best chance of getting out with money in your pocket. Set your targets of how much you realistically want to make and then get out.

It helps to keep in mind that you won't get it right every single time. You are going to lose some, but as long as you learn why you didn't, it will help you get it right next time.",t3_lcyyee,1612515619.0,2021-02-05 09:00:19,0.9396,0.05,0.851,0.098,Positive

These games are not for the faint of heart...last night was meant to filter out the weak and newbies by scaring them away. It was obviously a mistake to advertise that pump so heavily and make it mainstream when most people are not prepared mentally for the ‚Äúmind games‚Äù that it entails. Clearly, this whale jumped right in to splash our faces and it scared a lot of the newcomers away. Whoever that was, it was actually a huge favor in the sense that we can now get to role with those aware of the dangers and liabilities associated with trading and that we‚Äôre not playing it out as a joke or as a meme anymore.

This thing with tipping, and using doge to show appreciation for each other and for creators and things like that - if that's what defines the coin, how can we lean into that and build out, rather than trying to make it into something which already exists (the US dollar)?

I‚Äôd make a post about this but I am new to Reddit lol. (Someone plz make a post about this) I‚Äôm new to Reddit but I am not new to Dogecoin - been holding 200k since 2018

Dogecoin community is pure love and kindness! :) this what makes it valuable to me. Literally increases my quality of life.

162," I believe doge is about to rise. Its right at the point on the last wave where it started to climb up before the crash. The next few hours we'll see an increase, based on what I'm seeing, if it repeats the same pattern it did last time, which it has so far

this is the pattern it's been repeating from last time so far:

If I'm correct in this assessment, then we're either beginning or ending section C (it's a little hard to tell which exactly that pattern is matching, but I think we're at the end of C now) and we're due for another section of decent rise, which should push us up to a stable level at or above the last push/crash. There will be a crash after that, but everyone that got sucked in on the last pump should feel even at that point, and ready to ride the next wave into profitability

When you zoom out to the Doge month graph, it looks more clearly like a repeating pattern, and gives more confidence to my prediction:

NOTE: This is in no way financial advice and I am in no way an expert. These are just my thoughts as someone who has been trading crypto for all of 2 days and made a decent (20%) profit, and is now in the red for having bought into Doge on the last dump like probably a lot of people did.

171,"Trying to think of ways to help legitimize Dogecoin and make it more than a speculation investment. My understanding of dogecoin thus far is it is designed to help people understand crypto (in a world wear crypto is becoming more influential everyday), and it is a great way to ""tip"" or donate to people on the internet. Below are some ideas I've thought about for less than 24hrs so if they are stupid or lacking understanding of crypto, please share your knowledge!

 What I've thought of so far

1. getting indie game outlets to allow us to tip developers  for small games that are often sold for practically nothing. Or even tip twitch streamers who introduce us to games we would have never found on our own. How can we talk to groups like Steam or Xbox GamePass to offer a tipping methods through their system? Is this even possible? I think this is great because it hits on the one of the core purposes of dogecoin - fundraising. 
2. Work with a charity (ideally with an emphasis on children, because who loves memes more than kids?) to allow donations via doge coin. I think from a marketing standpoint it allows us small investors feel comfortable with the pennies we put into doge coin because not only do we get hands-on-learning with crypto currency, but we can always donate what we have (whether we gain or lose) to good causes. 
3. Encourage people in our doge communities (and all crypto communities for that matter) to purchase doge through tools/apps that work as or with crypto wallets. With rumors of most of us newcomers using Robinhood as a method to purchase dogecoin, doesn't this ultimately hurt the potential of dogecoin? My understanding is dogecoin purchased through RH has no value to an investor until it is sold. With so many investments in doge coin for the purpose of selling later to make $$, as opposed to buying and then exchanging the coin directly for good & services, doesn't this make the coin more volatile?
4. Work with financial education institutions (if we could ever convince any) to use doge as a small time investment education tool on crypto currency and investments. I can totally picture a high school economics class investing a whole 5$ into doge and studying it over the course of their school year. Any potential gains they can donate either to their school or to another charity. Anyone know and econ teachers?

What do you guys think about these things? Would any of these actually help doge go from speculation to a truly valued investment? 

Would anyone want to work together to make these or other ideas a reality?",t3_lcyyee,1612572854.0,2021-02-06 00:54:14,0.9953,0.017,0.84,0.143,Positive

178,"I just want to throw in my story for what it's worth. I bought in on RH before the big jump in price and before restrictions. Bought 69,272 doge at 0.014ish. The money was gains from over 5 years of investing in traditional stocks. Watched it climb and saw $5k in unrealized gains within 24hrs (more than I'd ever seen in my traditional stocks in 5 years!). Then watched that fall and got nervous about the pump and dumps and what not. So I sold a portion to pull out my initial investment. Then watched the rest fall even more. I took notice of the RH shenanigans and advice here to move away from RH and into an actual crypto app/service. Signed up for binance. Still waiting for that account to verify. Sold all my doge coins at a $600 total profit due to poor timing. My plan is to buy as I can using binance and an actual wallet, if I can figure out how to do so! 

Lessons Learned: Don't buy into something without a plan. I had no plan and somehow got lucky to not lose money. But it really could've gone wrong. 

This is a fun community, I look forward to getting more involved. I have an idea to 3D print dogecoins and offer them up for fun or good causes. Let me know if this kind of thing is already happening or not allowed.

391,"\[GUIDE\] How to TRADE Dogecoin 2/5/21 (not enough account age to post, please karma!)

Some things to know before you get started.

1. It is OK to trade!  Using this method you will be hodl+ing.  Primarily hodling and improving your position over time.  Trading helps prevent spikes and dips so you are providing an important service and will get paid to do it.
2. Elon is our daddy.  Being successful trading in the last 7 months and into the indefinite future of DOGE will require you come to terms with this fact.  Right now elon is telling us to keep the coin stable.  Daddy has set bumpers around $0.04-0.05 so expect doge to stay in this range for the near future until daddy changes tactics.  He might bump the price to a new level and keep it stable there every once in a while to generate interest.

Now to get started:

1. Buy Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is currently in a bull run for the next roughly 4-10 months so get comfy.
2. Get on Binance.  Binance is where daddy lives (in USDT but you need to be in BTC).  If you can't access binance just remember the mantra ""In Doge - We are all Canadians"".
3. Feather in.  When you first get your bitcoin into binance, don't trade for a day.  Watch the markets.  Then enter small.  Buy a dip with around 1/10-1/100 of your bitcoin.  Keep putting in small orders to buy dips.  Use the ""limit"" option and think like you are fishing for dips.
4. When you have reached doge/btc parity (you have equal value in both); get comfy.  Congrats.  Now set sell's above $0.045 and set buys below $0.045.  Where you choose exactly is an artform and it takes time to get good.  But know this, putting in orders at an amount early helps you get your order filled first when that price hits.  A way I like to do this is put in orders for values where not a lot of traders have orders in at.
5. SLEEP!  Set your nets before you sleep (with buys low and sells high) and take er easy.
6. Reasses your position.  Are you overbought (in doge)?  Remove some of your buys and set more sells.  Are you oversold (in doge)? Remove some of your sells and set more buys.  Your trades should each be around 1/100th of your holdings.  Win small loose small.
7. Watch your stack ratchet up.  Your overall btc holdings when you look in your binance wallet should grow over time, and that is the point.
8. Look for tweets from daddy.  Last strategy of 24-hour-long-bull-runs is over.  Current strategy of day-trading is in.  Things will likely change in the future due to daddy changing up the approach.

What do I know?  I was an original investor in Yenten in 2017.  Got left behind during the pump because I sold all my yenten early.  Investor in BTC at the top of 2017.  Lost it all going all-in on litecoincash at like 2 cents.  Been studying elon musk for a few years.  Been around the block a few times and lost it all so I learned some valuable lessons.",t3_lcyyee,1612530259.0,2021-02-05 13:04:19,0.9918,0.026,0.863,0.111,Positive

For all of those thinking Elon is just trying to manipulate Dogecoin for his own benefit: He is and he's not and I will tell you why:

**Elon is doing this because he has nothing to lose, but everything to gain.**

1. When he tweets, he almost certainly builds wealth that he can use to put into his companies or future projects. That benefits us as well if he succeeds.
2. He's making good money for a lot of people that have had a hard time this past year. He may even be saving small businesses or someone's life.
3. He knows that his brand name/image is only growing in a positive light amongst the younger population. The future generations will remember what Elon did for them and will likely be future customers buying goods and services from his companies.

**The Path to $1: As Presented by Doge in a Dream**

Hello all my dogey¬†doges¬†out there. Fear not. I know today was a rollercoaster, but we are in a good place. On that note I'd like to share with you all a dream I had last night, in which Doge appeared to me and laid out very plainly the steps we, the Dogecoin community and¬†early adopters, need to take for Dogecoin to reach $1 in the next year. I don't know why I was chosen by Doge to be the conduit, but I treat is as an honor and can only do my duty to pass it on to as many Doge followers, present and future, as possible.

In the dream, Doge explained to me that we are in the early stages of the Dogecoin revolution. The recent pumps were tests of the power of the people.¬†Doge knows that we the people now know how powerful we truly are, and Doge believes we are ready to take the next steps.¬†The tests are completed and passed. Dogecoin and Dogecoin HODLERS performed beautifully. Confidence in crypto has never been higher. We decide how much Dogecoin is worth. People see the writing on the wall. And it looks suspiciously like Doge's handwriting. The time is now. 2021 is the year of the Doge, and the Doge will not be stopped.¬†

Doge's path is simple and methodical.¬†

**From this day forward, the 1st of** ***every*** **month is Doge Day.**

On each Doge Day, Dogecoin holders the world around will spread the gospel of Doge far and wide. We will post on every social platform we have access to. We will wish the world Happy Doge Day and tell everyone to go buy some Dogecoin and join our revolution. And make no mistake, Doge was very clear that this is indeed a revolution. Recent events have shown us just how fragile the 1% are, the constructs they have used to keep the rich rich and the poor poor are poised to crumble around them, and it is we the people who have the power to make that happen.

The first Doge Day will be **March 1st** of this year. Be ready to strike my dogey doges. It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a dogey¬†doge world. It's your world. Take it.¬†

**The 5 steps of Doge's Path to $1:**

1. The first of every month is now Doge Day
2. Every Doge Day we must spread the gospel of Doge on every platform we have access to and encourage others to join us and buy Dogecoin
3. Every Doge Day we ourselves also buy more Dogecoin and hold, hold, hold
4. Watch and rejoice in the micro rallies resulting from our actions on Doge Day. Watch Dogecoin soar to new heights each Doge Day and stabilize well above where we started, growing more and more month after month. No pumping and dumping, only pumping and pumping
5. Wait for the next Doge Day and do it all again

Doge said if we follow these steps we will be well on our way to $1 by the end of the year.

**What work Doge asks of the Dogecoin community before our first Doge Day:**

* Get to work on your memes now--""Doge Day is coming,"" ""Happy Doge Day,"" ""Doge Day only comes 12 times a year,"" ""Year of the Doge,""""Who let the Doge out?,""¬†etc--we will need them to help spread Doge's message. Note that Doge has chosen the Doge Day rally song: Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's ""1st of Da Month""--""wake up, wake up, wake up, it's the first of the month; so get up, get up, get up, cash your checks and BUY DOGE.""
* Spread this post far and wide by whatever means you can, repost forever
* All creative hodlers--Doge wants to see this developing mythology promoted beyond the memes, we are talking 2021 Doge Day calendars w/ the first of the month circled with Doge heads, graphics of the 5 Point Path to $1, drawings and paintings of Doge delivering the¬†Path in a dream, etc...anything you can create to spread the message. Think big. Think biblical, prophetical, history in the making. Our grandchildren will be studying these works of art. Post 'em, spread 'em, like 'em, love 'em, let 'em work, let 'em live.¬†

The creativity and drive of this group is what will make this revolution possible. Like I said, I am just the mouthpiece Doge has chosen to spread the gospel. It is each and every one of you who will make the dream a reality. See you all on Doge Day.

In Doge we trust.

823,"I wrote a poem ü§∑


The Coin Prophecy

In time of the great happening,
when rich was full but still so fattening. 

We noticed through the internet,
the habitat of the telepath. 

Paths are in the light of Aquarius
follow me down to the hole
if at all you're curious. 

We needed a corporation,
an empaths way of cooperation. 

We shook hands, we agreed, we cooperated.
GME we, oh so,elevated. 

Now through cooperation, 
We can end this cycle of incarnation. 

What could be more prophetic
Than rise of meme coin ret@rdation? 

Annihilate the system of the unconcerned,
giving back the coins so long that's been yearned. 

In sight of the Irony,
saving you from restless toil of the salary. 

So go long the coin thats been claimed,
attain the love they severely drained.",t3_ldp6yo,1612613466.0,2021-02-06 12:11:06,0.5994,0.098,0.786,0.116,Positive

976,"This was my second time investing in cryptocurrency, and I feel like my experience may resonate with a lot of other people who joined this community.

The first time I invested in crypto i got bitcoin. It was confusing- down to a percentage of a bitcoin to pay for an item just made the currency awkwardly undesirable to use. Sure, it seemed like an easy way to make some money when the .000086 of bitcoin i had increased in value, but I never considered using it.

Dogecoin just FEELS different. It seems practical on the internet, with an amicable approach to anonymous payment with simple units. Dogecoin may never rise to the level of bitcoin- it wasn‚Äôt designed to. It feels, both as a currency and in this community, like a breath of fresh air. Very simply, currency is just anything that we assign value to, and no matter the ups and downs, this sub has shown that the value we put into our little shibas is only growing.

If you divide 10.5 billion by 128 billion, you get exactly 0.08. If we want the value of dogecoin to go higher, we're going to need the market capital to rise even higher. 15 billion market cap will give us $0.11 per dogecoin, 20 billion market cap will give us $0.15, 50 billion/$0.39, 80 billion/$0.62 and so forth.

Things it won't do is be bitcoin. Things it can do is move up to the #3 position and become a standard for general users. I'm backing it because I believe in it. But at this point it has to be seen as a long term play to get there. The more it grows steadily the more it is diversified in who owns it. 

Do not just dump into it thinking you will be rich by the end of the week. If you had that kind of money you would already be rich anyway. I think my buddy had the best mind set when he put in what he could afford and is now refusing to even look at it for a year.

I only started dabbling in investing as a way to learn something new. I got intrested due to reading about the GME stock craziness but hated the wallstreetsbets culture. 


I stumbled on Dogecoin and said screw it with $50 when it was at .04ish. Then I stumbled onto the sub reddit and dropped another $100 because if I am investing its for the long haul and with people that want to do good in the world! Not just make a quick buck. I am up about $100! Doge for life through dips and new floors. 

Also, never invest more than you are willing to lose. I equate my investing dollars to if I find myself at a casino. It is supposed to be fun not I NEED to pay off my house. Granted, if it happens... GREAT! But I need to pay my bills first. (Not a financial advisor. Just some person on the internet.)

I look forward the highs and lows. I look forward to donating to our local communities. I look forward to being a good doge.

1699,"People r stressing about doge not having a cap which ruins the value of it. So, Bitcoin was created to be a CURRENCY, however because Bitcoin has a hard market cap, it makes Bitcoin way more valuable, and that‚Äôs why a Bitcoin is $50k. 

But because bitcoins price is now so high, Bitcoin is starting to become more of an asset then a currency.

Dogecoin not having a hard cap is value in itself because it makes dogecoin more sustaining, and also, it keeps the values of dogecoin at a reasonable price so it stays as a currency rather then an asset. 

After all the all these cryptos are made to be currency, that‚Äôs the end goal, so the most probable crypto in my opinion to come out ontop is the crypto that mimics modern currency minus government control which is literally dogecoin. And I think that is that elon sees as well.

we were gonna just pay off the entire student loan debt total via bank defaults, but maybe it would be more fun if students got the satisfaction of paying the loans off themselves?

1821,"To those who wish for .10 so quickly after we BARELY hit .07 yesterday, keep in mind: The market does what it wants. Just look at the weekly chart and breathe easy. We're on the rise. 

When it gets to .10 per coin, then you might see a parabolic rise as people start taking doge REALLY seriously (deep pocket investors and institutions) that could make a crazy bull run to $1. 

Or, it could come crashing down hard. Remember, the largest holder of dogecoin has a wallet with 36 BILLION dogecoins. Every time it goes up even a penny, that person is 360 MILLION USD richer if they sold. If they totally liquidated at .10, they would've realized 3.6 billion dollars in gains, but the market would likely tank all the way to under .02 or even completely under a penny.

1825,"üê∂üê∂With Doge being low again today it's a great time to buy and stock up.

Right now Doge is at .05

So let's have some fun with math. 

$1 √∑ .05 = 20 Dogecoin

$1=20 Doge

$100 =2,000 Doge

$1000=20,000 Doge

So say 100 people buy $100(2000 Doge) each.

100 people = 200,000 Doge

1000 people = 2 Million Doge

100,000 people = 20 Million Doge

And so...

We donot need Elon tweets or whales to help bring Doge price up again. We can do it with team work. This Dogecoin reddit group has over 1.2 million people. Plus think of all the other regular people like us  buying too.

Great Teamwork goes a long way. üê∂üöÄüåõ",t3_lvagu9,1614616435.0,2021-03-01 16:33:55,0.9393,0.015,0.865,0.12,Positive

Beside everything that is on the instagram profile, she also accepts orders and she's shipping worldwide. 

Most of the descriptions are in Portuguese, but if you DM her in English she will answer to all your questions.

(I'm not sure the daily discussion is the best spot to make a post like this, if you have any advise on that I will appreciate it!)

Doge has grown stronger in the past day, and we must be thankful for it. But now is not the time for irrational thought, think on the progress of doge in the face of adversity. Solidify your resolve to hodl until we reach the sanctuary of the moon.

""Dogecoin price on the verge of a new breakout¬†

Dogecoin has established an ascending triangle pattern on the 12-hour chart with a resistance trendline formed at $0.062¬†and basically no resistance ahead.¬†Since DOGE has defended the lower boundary of the pattern, it will most likely rise towards the top at $0.062.¬†


A breakout above the upper trendline of the pattern at $0.0628 should quickly¬†drive Dogecoin price towards $0.083 with no difficulties. The In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) chart adds credence to this outlook as it shows practically no barriers ahead.""

"" Keep in mind that the positive outlook depends on DOGE‚Äôs ability to defend the 50 24-hour Moving Average (MA). If Dogecoin manages to bypass this level, a 10 percent retracement is likely to happen, a move that will push DOGE‚Äôs price towards the $0.048 region.  If worst comes to worst, DOGE traders will sell the crypto asset to slice it through the parallel channel‚Äôs lower trendline, which rests at the $0.048 region. If this happens, DOGE‚Äôs bullish outlook will fade away, and the news will attract a 15 percent selling spree. Bulls need to come out and assist DOGE in arresting the current bearish trend that could see the crypto coin depreciating by 20 percent if it catches momentum. ""

* **Dogecoin price lacks volatility as Bollinger Bands tightly envelop it.**
* **A bullish breach of the no-trade zone extending from $0.056 to $0.059¬†might see DOGE surge 20% to $0.072.**
* **An 8% downswing to $0.051 is like if the $0.056 level is breached.**

[**Dogecoin price**](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/dogecoin-price-forecast-doge-is-back-on-track-to-hit-all-time-highs-202103181822) awaits a clear trend to establish as it trades in a no-trade zone.

## Dogecoin price stays lull

Dogecoin price has been [**trending higher**](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-doge-bulls-can-stay-hopeful-above-these-levels-202103172335), albeit slowly. At the time of writing, Bollinger Bands are squeezing DOGE, which indicates a lack of [**volatility**](https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/volatility) and reduced market participants. So long as the meme coin remains within the no-trade zone ranging from $0.056 to $0.059, volatile moves cannot be expected.

However, if Dogecoin price manages to pierce through the upper boundary of this no-trade zone, a bullish narrative could evolve. In this case, DOGE could first surge 8% to $0.064.

A decisive close above this combined with the persistence of [**buying pressure**](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/dogecoin-price-prediction-doge-could-surge-45-if-this-key-level-holds-202103170308) could further propel the meme coin to $0.072, coinciding with the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement level",t3_m9th5y,1616349928.0,2021-03-21 18:05:28,0.6124,0.013,0.941,0.046,Positive

Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE primed for another parabolic run

Robinhood CEO signals support for Dogecoin fans
In a fireside chat on March 19, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev talked about Dogecoin and its community. He stated:

The Dogecoin community has really embraced Robinhood, which has been really awesome to see, and it's a fun community.

Following this chat, the CEO took to his Twitter as he joined American snack brand Slim Jim in tweeting DOGE memes.


Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin price is mainly affected by social chatter. Hence, if the crowd jumps on the DOGE bandwagon due to these memes, it could undoubtedly push the meme coin‚Äôs price to new highs.

Dogecoin price prepares or a lift-off
Dogecoin price pulled back almost 52% over three weeks starting from February 1. Since then, things are beginning to look up for the meme coin as its market value has appreciated 54%.


Additionally, Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects could turn bullish if investors push the meme coin past the $0.087 supply barrier to create a new all-time high. In this case, FOMO could play a crucial role in further propelling the altcoin higher.

If history were to repeat, Dogecoin price could surge 1000% to hit 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $0.96.

However, investors could take pitstops around the 127.2% and 141.4% Fibonacci extension levels at $0.252 and $0.438, respectively.


Santiment‚Äôs Social Volume chart was on the dot in predicting Dogecoin‚Äôs crash. A massive bearish divergence between Dogecoin price and this metric led to an enormous drop in DOGE‚Äôs market value.

Hence, this time around, a spike in social chatter could serve as a buy signal for investors that could propel the meme coin close to $1.

Question if Dogecoin jumped to $17 Billion dollars trade volume again like it did back in january 28th would that then make it move from $0.057 to $0.57?   


As thats roughly the same increase it had last time?

At the moment its still at $0.057 even though the trade volume is at its all time lowest of $600 million trade volume since January 28th which to me, means it has stabilized and if it was to get to $17 billion trade volume it would have the same increase.

3753,"Stand your ground! 

Stimies are trickling in because the big banks only hold 5% of your hard earned deposits and loan the rest out. They couldn't back the checks and had to wait to get funded. That's why we didn't see a jump in investments like we expected. -yet... and that's ok. The money is coming in slowly.

When Robinhood releases the doge to private wallets we'll see the true market movement. Right now 28% sheltered. This in itself could completely change the game.

When Coinbase jumps on the doge train there will be 43M users that will be able to buy doge without opening a new acount somewhere else. What do you think will happen when the shibe runs?

3905,"üê∂üê∂With Doge being low again today it's a great time to buy and stock up.

Right now Doge is at .05

So let's have some fun with math.

$1 √∑ .05 = 20 Dogecoin

$1=20 Doge

$100 =2,000 Doge

$1000=20,000 Doge

So say 100 people buy $100(2000 Doge) each.

100 people = 200,000 Doge

1000 people = 2 Million Doge

100,000 people = 20 Million Doge

And so...

We donot need Elon tweets or whales to help bring Doge price up again. We can do it with team work. This Dogecoin reddit group has over 1.2 million people. Plus think of all the other regular people like us buying too.

Add that on top of the stock market failing all this week, and it's easy to see why Doge is also falling right now.

My best guess is that after Bitcoin (and all other cryptos) fall as much as 20% or more (they're expecting Bitcoin to fall as low as 44,000 Friday), then downward selling pressure will stop and the price of Bitcoin (and all other cryptos as a result including Doge) can resume their upward trend.

* **Dogecoin snapped a five-day losing streak on Friday.**
* **Key resistance in the near-term is located at $0.0570.**
* **A daily close below $0.04750 could drag the price fresh multi-month lows.**

Dogecoin closed in the negative territory for five straight days and touched its lowest level in two weeks at $0.04965 before staging a rebound on Friday. As of writing, DOGE was posting modest daily gains at $0.05480.

## Dogecoin closes in on key resistance

The 20-day SMA and the 50-day SMA are both located a little above the current price level at¬†around $0.0570. Moreover, the Fibonacci 38.2% retracement of Jan. 28 - Feb. 7 upsurge is reinforcing that area as resistance. If Dogecoin manages to make a daily close above that hurdle, the door opens for additional gains toward $0.06630 (static resistance) and $0.06690 (Fibonacci 23.6% retracement).

On the other hand, the near-term **outlook** could turn bearish if DOGE flips $0.04760 (Fibonacci 50% retracement) support into resistance and bears could aim for fresh multi-month lows at $0.0380 (Fibonacci 50% retracement).

¬†IntoTheBlock's In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model shows that the price remains stuck between strong resistance and support areas. The significance of the $0.0570 hurdle is confirmed by the IOMAP, which shows that more than 6.2¬†billion DOGE had been acquired by nearly 135K addresses $0.05746.

On the flip side, the IOMAP suggests that sellers could have a difficult time bringing the price down¬†to the key $0.04760 area identified above with several strong support areas forming before it.¬†

&#x200B;

Although Dogecoin continues to move sideways in the big picture, the recent price action and the IOMAP chart point to possible additional gains if the coin manages to clear $0.0570.",t3_meambw,1616861485.0,2021-03-27 16:11:25,0.9468,0.059,0.828,0.113,Positive

4339,"Technical analysis, price predictions and news on cryptocurrency Dogecoin for week ending 03/27/2021. Doge lost its momentum to the upside as it was about to break above 6 cent resistance until the Bitcoin and the overall crypto market sold off. Doge is still trading within the consolidation zone between 5 and 6 cents. The longer it trades within this range, the bigger the move will be when it breaks out! Bull case price targets for next week is that Doge will retest 6 cents resistance until finally breaking out, then heading up to the next resistance level at 7 cents. To the downside, there is very strong support at 5 cents that only really bearish news would cause it to break below in my opinion. The next support below that is 4.4 cents.

4413,"Just so everyone is aware, RH isn't commission free.They are just playing the game. It's the same thing that refineries do for gold assay. I know because I'm a gold dealer since 2008. 
If RH always undercuts doges value by just a few fractions of a percent....compared to the actual value being shown by other brokers, you will always leave them a tiny gap of profit in the price. So if you sell at .062 on RH....you will notice on your sales receipt that they conducted the sale at something closer to .060. They also do similar when you buy. You buy at one price and the sales receipt shows you bought it at a higher price than when you pushed the button. In my industry this is referred to as ""skimming"". They are playing those gaps and pocketing the difference between them. 
NTR metals refinery was notorious for skimming. My 14k gold assay was supposed to always test at between .583 to .585 pure to be sold as 14k since jewelry companies cannot stamp 14k on gold jewelry unless the metal meets the standard. But many many times upon melt and cashout my correctly marked 14k gold was showing assayed on their sheet at around .576 to .580. So they found a way to pay me a little less money.

I believe Robinhood acts as it‚Äôs own internal ‚Äúcrypto exchange‚Äù and during the maintenance periods they are buying the coins from actual exchanges.

4779,"You have to be realistic and always look at the marketcap. Price is not that important. I think DOGECOIN has potential hiting 100Bilion MC in 3 years very easily. It would be depending on global awareness and of course if major players like COINBASE would include DOGE to their offer. I see DOGE special in one particular way which tells me DOGE cannot replaced with other currencies and cannot be forgotten. All todays major cryptos which has utility could be replace by better future projects with simply better features (technology is exploding) BUT BITCOIN and DOGECOIN, has something more in their ""DNA"" which makes them popular among the people not because they are technologicaly perfect but due to positive relation with people and i think this is the main ARGUMENT which tells me to hold and do not look at the price and count how much I ve already made. BITCOIN is where it is because it was the FIRST crypto and technologicaly is very poor in comparisson to todays crypto BUT its valuable becauae people gives it vaule. I can see DOGECOIN doing the same in long term because its unique, it has more and more casual people involved and it simply can not be raplaced by other meme coin. DOGE is the first internet meme coin.

5129,"For everyone making a quick buck for the past two months day trading, let me fill you in:

Dogecoin rose to .08 from .0088 in late Jan when $4 billion of Bitcoin options expired. Late Feb and all throughout March was pretty dead which made it easy to trade Doge. At the end of March, $6 billion of Bitcoin options expired. Since then, almost every well known coin and even some we‚Äôve never heard of has mooned except Dogecoin.

Dogecoin will not be dropping below .065 and possibly .07 unless the entire market has a huge dip. It‚Äôs math. It‚Äôs basic market analysis.

Look at ETH for example. It had been sideways between 1500-1800 for about as long as Doge was between .05-.07. Now ETH hit another ATH this past week. 

If you think Doge won‚Äôt hit a new ATH in the next few days, then you are mistaken. This is your moment to buy in now and fkin hold this time instead of making measly $100-$300 profits. There WILL be a moment where you are wrong in your predictions and miss out. 

People who traded Bitcoin may have made some profit but Bitcoin HOLDERS benefited the most. If you‚Äôre thinking about buying in, then is your moment to buy, hold and reap the benefits a year from now. Maybe even a month from now.",t3_mooywl,1618168859.0,2021-04-11 19:20:59,0.6869,0.033,0.906,0.061,Positive

5198,"I dont think buying and holding is the way to increase value. The difference between e.g. btc and doge is btc have a limited supply and so with every coin mined depletes the availability and increases their value due to scarcity. Similar to a precious  metal such as gold, and why btc is seen as more of a store of value than a potential future currency. 
The difference with doge is that there is an unlimited supply and so it is harder to drive an increase in value by mining/owning more. If anything, the more of something there is the less valuable it becomes.
So the best way to increase the value of doge or any crypto for that matter is to encourage global acceptance and to make it a useful coin to be bought and sold. Or... alternatively/in addition to, someone new needs to take the coin in a different direction. If e.g. doge was to become limited supply it would literally reach the moon. However this would make it another store of value similar to btc, and the potential to become a currency would be lost. Central banks are already making plans to get control of the crypto which will make that $1 even harder to reach, but with enough people anything is possible. A $10 price, as it stands today, is impossible, unless the whole doge ethos changes. ""Over to you Elon Musk"" lol",t3_mooywl,1618143628.0,2021-04-11 12:20:28,0.9663,0.018,0.844,0.138,Positive

How to Buy Dogecoin as Meme Cryptocurrency's Price Goes Up
Jason Murdock 2 hrs ago

The price of the meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin rose by around 20 percent on Sunday after a cryptic tweet by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

Users of the token, which was started as a joke in 2013, have rallied behind the coin in the past two days, once again hyping it up with the aim of pushing its price upwards. As of Monday, a single Dogecoin was the equivalent of $0.072.

On Saturday, Dogecoin was priced at around $0.061, but that shot to $0.078 in a matter of 24 hours, according to CoinDesk's real-time price tracker.

The surge came after a tweet from Musk, a known Dogecoin fan, that read ""... going to moon very soon."" The slogan ""to the moon"" is used to describe a major cryptocurrency price rally.",t3_mp9v2y,1618233306.0,2021-04-12 13:15:06,0.6757,0.0,0.96,0.04,Positive
