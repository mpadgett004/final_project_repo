      "\n",
      "Hi Shibes!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's a good idea to take a step back and see what we have accomplished within the last WEEK rather than trying to group buy and get all bent out of shape when things don't become the outcome you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, before making an investment, you need to play jury in the sense you need to gather all the facts and weigh the bear and the bull case. I am a firm believer the bull case outweighs the bear case and you can do your own research on this, but if having the richest man in the world on your side doesn't tell you something, than I don't know what does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't group buy because of hype, buy Doge because you believe in it for a better future. I am a believer in Doge and I have been since 2014. This coin is fun with groundbreaking new technology with the capability of changing payment methods as we know it, it's growing at a pace I never thought would be imaginable and we are only getting started. Being in wild swings in the beginning to todays current events, I never thought we would be steady around 4 - 5 cents. That is truly remarkable. On a side note, if you are looking to make profit, maybe consider day trading if you are confident in your abilities. If not, buy and hold Dogecoin. It is not going anywhere and with the recent community gain and the backing of Elon Musk and new businesses accepting as a payment method, this may dip short term, but in the long run it will only go up.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Some Great Facts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-Dogecoin is up around 30% today as I am typing this, over 400% for the month.  \n",
      "\\-Dogecoin has a market cap of around 6 billion USD, placing us at #11, not taking into account Tether or USDC  \n",
      "\\-A billionare out in the world with an anonymous address owns 34B doge and has been holding and accumulating for a long time. [https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L)  \n",
      "\\-Our Dogecoin Subreddit has gained 700k if not more new members in the past week (WELCOME NEW SHIBES SO WOW, VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU!)  \n",
      "\\-Elon Musk loves Dogecoin and Mark Cuban has mentioned us and we are getting media coverage everywhere and some very awesome shibes have taken it upon themselves to purchase billboards to spread the message  \n",
      "\\-Dogecoin is the number one most mentioned thing on Twitter in history\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, if these facts do not excite you, than maybe you should consider a change in your mindset and approach to Dogecoin. Maybe you bought in high. I am a believer over time this will find new highs, higher than 8 cents. Maybe coinbase will start working with Dogecoin. Maybe Elon will drop some crazy news. The possibilities are endless. That would all be wonderful and barrier to entry with legit coins would be so much better than just buying with Robinhood which so many people are doing and  \n",
      "I believe defeats the whole purpose of remaining anonymous and decentralized, given the recent events with Robinhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, take care of yourselves. Being glued to the screen watching all the dips and freaking out over losing a number on a screen is not worth the stress. Save yourself alot of heartache, buy and hold, work hard, take care of yourself, drink plenty of water, really just do you.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we can accomplish all this within one week, where are we going to be in 1 month? 6 months? 1 year? The future looks incredibly bright for Dogecoin and well, HODL and buckle up, because it may be bumpy, but it's going to be one hell of a ride! 0.9988\n",
      "Like I said in the other daily thread, we need to stop scheduling pump times. All it does is tell the Whales when we're planning to buy more Doge, and lets them plan their dumps more easily, which always causes a panic, which always drives prices lower. I don't think a single planned pump has been successful on this sub over the last week and every one of them has ended (in the last case, it started) in a massive drop in price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't use Dogecoin to make a quick buck unless you are really good at reading the highs and lows. I'm holding my 60,000 Doge to Alpha Centauri and beyond. I suggest others do the same and realize that the price will hit $0.10  in the next few weeks/months. It will happen. If you absolutely have to, just set a sell limit of 10 cents and walk away for a few months. Your broker will send you an email when it sells. Yeah, you might miss out if the price goes a little higher, but you won't be panic selling or getting frustrated at the price not going anywhere. There is momentum on our side, but unless Elon Musk is literally holding our hands with his tweets, it is not happening in a day. -0.2033\n",
      "After holding it pays off can we all meet at a resort somewhere and create some sort of festival. “Dogefest” is the best name I can come up with at the moment. 0.8484\n",
      "Ive invested 20$ into dogecoin. I know its not much but its what im willing to lose cz this girl still has tuition and rent to pay😭 im holding with you all!! 🚀🚀 -0.8715\n",
      "If you’re looking for another pump, this isn’t the place. We don’t condone nor support pumps. We are in this together to make doge a reliable coin with a steady increase. If you’re not willing to be patient and hold at 4.5 cents then idk what to tell ya other than peace out! 0.5321\n",
      "I really wish that this sub was more moderated. At the moment, due to the large influx of novices to the crypto ecosystem, we're seeing a lot of misinformation being flung left and right. Individuals who don't realize the dynamics of investment, (most notably the pump and dumps we keep seeing repeatedly) are parroting the \"buy at X time\" or \"to the moon tonight\" rhetoric that feeds the whale behaviour and only furthers the losses for those very same novice investors. Even if bots and the aforementioned whales are the precursors for this kind of behaviour, it's important to restrict the spread from people who don't realize they're being taken advantage of and are in turn helping somebody else take advantage of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I'm disappointed that so many people are quick to sell at a loss, this is the nature of this sort of increase in value. What I don't want to see is the decline of Doge as people associate repeated loss with this crypto because of the constant pump and dumps that this sub incentivizes. Getting information out there, PR in general, is always good, but if people come and see nothing but actual children screaming at others to participate in a pump and dump while they themselves lose their investment (even if it is only a few dollars) we will only scare investors away from securing Doge as a real world use crypto. -0.9373\n",
      "Organizing pumps isn't a good idea. Holding and profiting off natural growth is. The seeds have been planted in the public over the past week or so, and now it's just a matter of interested people finally being ABLE to buy Doge. 0.796\n",
      "I appreciate how everyone here is really nice and it’s a really good pick me up from the culture at wallstreetbets 0.8396\n",
      "UNDERSTANDING PUMP AND DUMP AND THE BENEFIT OF HOLD \n",
      "\n",
      "Doge is gathering attention on bill boards in the Time Square!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, let me first put down a disclaimer. I have just been in this crypto market for half a year so i am still a newbie compare to all of you right here. But i have recognized a lack of understanding of the fundamental from new player and that is why i think it is very important that we clear some of the questio  that many people have and nobody tell them. Please correct me if i am wrong, i have no financial back ground and everything i say, i learnt the hard way\n",
      "\n",
      "1: so yesterday for Doge was a normal day, we recover from the previous dip until Elon musk tweet and back Doge, it resulted in a sharp increase of over 50% in a couple of hours. After that surge, things cool down and imediately there was people spreading news about a new pump at 9EST. Now why?\n",
      "A) they spread this news because every NEW player are excited. Super excited. Money over night. Put 5k in, walk out 6k. That is lovely.\n",
      "B) you have to ask yourself why people will schedule a pump and telling you which coin it is and what time it is.  If you check the time frame, doge before the spread of the pump news is already 0.05 which is high compare to its floor price before. Now yall excited. People start buying in and drive the price up. \n",
      "\n",
      "But think about the whales, if they really want to pump a coin, why would they tell you before hand. The coin goes up, which means that they wont make as much money from their own pump. Right? So something is wrong. Fundementally and pscychologically.\n",

      "Now when it is 9 est, the price imediately drop. Because new player was told to buy, the price didnt drop down as fast, leaving time for whales to sell their coins with good price. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART: some new player panic, sell all their coins to cut cost. The price drop even more. Now whales then buy back coins at dirt cheap price and started to wage for another pump in a few days.\n",

      "2) so what can we do? Why everybody said hold? Or buy the dip. It is rather logical isnt it? Let say there is 10 doge coin available. There is one whale and 2 holders and 3 newbie. Each holder got 1 coin, the whale got 4 and the rest on the market. \n",

      "The newbie buy all the coin in at high price, hoping the price go up. But the whale dump all their coin, so the price goes wayyyy down. Now if you are new, ya panic, ya sell all your coin. The price goes down harder. Now the whale buy 5 coins back. They now hold 5 but pay equal to 3 coins with price before the dump. \n",
      "\n",
      "What if yoy hold? Well its logiv right, if you hold, there wont be alot more coins on the market. If you and the holder both hold, now there is only 5 coins on the market. Less supply means: better price. So even if the price actually dip, when it stop dipping it will have a higher floor than the last time before this whole trading scenario. \n",

      "I hope everybody learn something from this, particularly newbie. If you have a strong community of holders, then it is not a bad things to hold. Besides, if you invested everything in a coin and complain that you have lost everything then it is you fault first. Blame yourself first, but then think about the whole thing and what can you learn.

      "Trying to think of ways to help legitimize Dogecoin and make it more than a speculation investment. My understanding of dogecoin thus far is it is designed to help people understand crypto (in a world wear crypto is becoming more influential everyday), and it is a great way to \"tip\" or donate to people on the internet. Below are some ideas I've thought about for less than 24hrs so if they are stupid or lacking understanding of crypto, please share your knowledge!\n",
      "\n",
      " What I've thought of so far\n",
      "\n",
      "1. getting indie game outlets to allow us to tip developers  for small games that are often sold for practically nothing. Or even tip twitch streamers who introduce us to games we would have never found on our own. How can we talk to groups like Steam or Xbox GamePass to offer a tipping methods through their system? Is this even possible? I think this is great because it hits on the one of the core purposes of dogecoin - fundraising. \n",
      "2. Work with a charity (ideally with an emphasis on children, because who loves memes more than kids?) to allow donations via doge coin. I think from a marketing standpoint it allows us small investors feel comfortable with the pennies we put into doge coin because not only do we get hands-on-learning with crypto currency, but we can always donate what we have (whether we gain or lose) to good causes. \n",
      "3. Encourage people in our doge communities (and all crypto communities for that matter) to purchase doge through tools/apps that work as or with crypto wallets. With rumors of most of us newcomers using Robinhood as a method to purchase dogecoin, doesn't this ultimately hurt the potential of dogecoin? My understanding is dogecoin purchased through RH has no value to an investor until it is sold. With so many investments in doge coin for the purpose of selling later to make $$, as opposed to buying and then exchanging the coin directly for good & services, doesn't this make the coin more volatile?\n",
      "4. Work with financial education institutions (if we could ever convince any) to use doge as a small time investment education tool on crypto currency and investments. I can totally picture a high school economics class investing a whole 5$ into doge and studying it over the course of their school year. Any potential gains they can donate either to their school or to another charity. Anyone know and econ teachers?\n",

      "I just want to throw in my story for what it's worth. I bought in on RH before the big jump in price and before restrictions. Bought 69,272 doge at 0.014ish. The money was gains from over 5 years of investing in traditional stocks. Watched it climb and saw $5k in unrealized gains within 24hrs (more than I'd ever seen in my traditional stocks in 5 years!). Then watched that fall and got nervous about the pump and dumps and what not. So I sold a portion to pull out my initial investment. Then watched the rest fall even more. I took notice of the RH shenanigans and advice here to move away from RH and into an actual crypto app/service. Signed up for binance. Still waiting for that account to verify. Sold all my doge coins at a $600 total profit due to poor timing. My plan is to buy as I can using binance and an actual wallet, if I can figure out how to do so! \n",

Don't pay attention to its current value though, focus more on the overall trend and you'll see that it's positive and gaining traction. If we continue to hold the line, we can prove to the world it is stable, which will attract more investors and gradually raise the baseline overtime. The higher the baseline gets, the more attractive it becomes to other investors, further raising the baseline. 💎🙌🚀🌚 0.9726\n",

      "\\[GUIDE\\] How to TRADE Dogecoin 2/5/21 (not enough account age to post, please karma!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Some things to know before you get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It is OK to trade!  Using this method you will be hodl+ing.  Primarily hodling and improving your position over time.  Trading helps prevent spikes and dips so you are providing an important service and will get paid to do it.\n",
      "2. Elon is our daddy.  Being successful trading in the last 7 months and into the indefinite future of DOGE will require you come to terms with this fact.  Right now elon is telling us to keep the coin stable.  Daddy has set bumpers around $0.04-0.05 so expect doge to stay in this range for the near future until daddy changes tactics.  He might bump the price to a new level and keep it stable there every once in a while to generate interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to get started:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Buy Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is currently in a bull run for the next roughly 4-10 months so get comfy.\n",
      "2. Get on Binance.  Binance is where daddy lives (in USDT but you need to be in BTC).  If you can't access binance just remember the mantra \"In Doge - We are all Canadians\".\n",
      "3. Feather in.  When you first get your bitcoin into binance, don't trade for a day.  Watch the markets.  Then enter small.  Buy a dip with around 1/10-1/100 of your bitcoin.  Keep putting in small orders to buy dips.  Use the \"limit\" option and think like you are fishing for dips.\n",
      "4. When you have reached doge/btc parity (you have equal value in both); get comfy.  Congrats.  Now set sell's above $0.045 and set buys below $0.045.  Where you choose exactly is an artform and it takes time to get good.  But know this, putting in orders at an amount early helps you get your order filled first when that price hits.  A way I like to do this is put in orders for values where not a lot of traders have orders in at.\n",
      "5. SLEEP!  Set your nets before you sleep (with buys low and sells high) and take er easy.\n",
      "6. Reasses your position.  Are you overbought (in doge)?  Remove some of your buys and set more sells.  Are you oversold (in doge)? Remove some of your sells and set more buys.  Your trades should each be around 1/100th of your holdings.  Win small loose small.\n",
      "7. Watch your stack ratchet up.  Your overall btc holdings when you look in your binance wallet should grow over time, and that is the point.\n",
      "8. Look for tweets from daddy.  Last strategy of 24-hour-long-bull-runs is over.  Current strategy of day-trading is in.  Things will likely change in the future due to daddy changing up the approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do I know?  I was an original investor in Yenten in 2017.  Got left behind during the pump because I sold all my yenten early.  Investor in BTC at the top of 2017.

Dogecoin and Dogecoin HODLERS performed beautifully. Confidence in crypto has never been higher. We decide how much Dogecoin is worth. People see the writing on the wall.

This drop in price is NORMAL, and needs to happen for PROPER GROWTH. If you view the drop as \"losing money\", then it's best to get out while you can because that means you're losing money that you can't afford to lose. I don't have a fortune invested in it atm, (only around 10K coins), but I plan to buy in more as the price fluctuates. Buying high and selling low out of fear DE-VALUES the coin.

Whereas DOGE has an annual 5 billion cap. The math prevents DOGE from being able to have the market cap necessary for massive growth. I don’t think we’d ever see a DOGE at $100 per coin or even $2k like we see with ETH. What are your opinions on this dilemma? I’ve got over 100k coins and don’t know if it’s worth it to hodl if it’ll never reach the amount I’d need for a $1M return. 0.3402\n",

      "\" Keep in mind that the positive outlook depends on DOGE’s ability to defend the 50 24-hour Moving Average (MA). If Dogecoin manages to bypass this level, a 10 percent retracement is likely to happen, a move that will push DOGE’s price towards the $0.048 region.  If worst comes to worst, DOGE traders will sell the crypto asset to slice it through the parallel channel’s lower trendline, which rests at the $0.048 region. If this happens, DOGE’s bullish outlook will fade away, and the news will attract a 15 percent selling spree. Bulls need to come out and assist DOGE in arresting the current bearish trend that could see the crypto coin depreciating by 20 percent if it catches momentum. \"\n",

      "In a fireside chat on March 19, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev talked about Dogecoin and its community. He stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dogecoin community has really embraced Robinhood, which has been really awesome to see, and it's a fun community.\n",

      "Following this chat, the CEO took to his Twitter as he joined American snack brand Slim Jim in tweeting DOGE memes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin price is mainly affected by social chatter. Hence, if the crowd jumps on the DOGE bandwagon due to these memes, it could undoubtedly push the meme coin’s price to new highs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dogecoin price prepares or a lift-off\n",
      "Dogecoin price pulled back almost 52% over three weeks starting from February 1. Since then, things are beginning to look up for the meme coin as its market value has appreciated 54%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Dogecoin’s prospects could turn bullish if investors push the meme coin past the $0.087 supply barrier to create a new all-time high. In this case, FOMO could play a crucial role in further propelling the altcoin higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "If history were to repeat, Dogecoin price could surge 1000% to hit 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $0.96.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, investors could take pitstops around the 127.2% and 141.4% Fibonacci extension levels at $0.252 and $0.438, respectively.\n",

      "Ok that's my assumption and agree but the difficult conversations dont take place over two people agreeing the market needs some form of stability my interest and focus is on the sustainability also but let's stop and think about this let's use gamestop for earnings and market perfect example so say I go and buy out every game and system in every store in a 50 mile radius tomorrow is that going to change the stock price( doge currency vs doge price on robinhood). no it's going give them a higher revenue not higher stock price so now if I spread the money I spent there over the next month and by the higher asks on the stock exchange is that going to pump the stock and then continue to do that over the next 2 years each month witch is going to be more effective? So I guess what I'm getting at is the matter of volume dont really matter to a point along as everyone sees value in it and continue to think it's worth $100, $1,000, $55,000  people on robin hood who are buying paper not coin are only setting the worth while the people holding the coin are hoping for the volume of supply and demand when in all actuality there could be a trillion coins on market with only 150,000 being purchased in total and the people wanting the cap are shorting it trying to buy more but the people shorting it are controlling the price we are looking for growth and people who value the coin not day traders and paper hands the more u buy at the higher price the higher the worth is if I say I'm buying coins at 100 dollars I might get burned but guess what that's cuz everyone thinks it's only worth 5 cents you want stability make the coin worth it it's more about passion for the movement vs being a 1000 richer in a year if theres was more passion and  less paper hands we would be good but right now all u see is volume because everyone is stuck on the dumb ape mindset of o less equals more supply and demand if there's less bananas they are worth more no the banana has always been your favorite fruit you just took it for granted and under valued it market am I wrong? 0.9929\n",

      "Technical analysis, price predictions and news on cryptocurrency Dogecoin for week ending 03/27/2021. Doge lost its momentum to the upside as it was about to break above 6 cent resistance until the Bitcoin and the overall crypto market sold off. Doge is still trading within the consolidation zone between 5 and 6 cents. The longer it trades within this range, the bigger the move will be when it breaks out! Bull case price targets for next week is that Doge will retest 6 cents resistance until finally breaking out, then heading up to the next resistance level at 7 cents. To the downside, there is very strong support at 5 cents that only really bearish news would cause it to break below in my opinion. The next support below that is 4.4 cents.\n",

It would be depending on global awareness and of course if major players like COINBASE would include DOGE to their offer. I see DOGE special in one particular way which tells me DOGE cannot replaced with other currencies and cannot be forgotten. All todays major cryptos which has utility could be replace by better future projects with simply better features (technology is exploding) BUT BITCOIN and DOGECOIN, has something more in their \"DNA\" which makes them popular among the people not because they are technologicaly perfect but due to positive relation with people and i think this is the main ARGUMENT which tells me to hold and do not look at the price and count how much I ve already made. BITCOIN is where it is because it was the FIRST crypto and technologicaly is very poor in comparisson to todays crypto BUT its valuable becauae people gives it vaule. I can see DOGECOIN doing the same in long term because its unique, it has more and more casual people involved and it simply can not be raplaced by other meme coin.

      "The difference with doge is that there is an unlimited supply and so it is harder to drive an increase in value by mining/owning more. If anything, the more of something there is the less valuable it becomes.\n",
      "So the best way to increase the value of doge or any crypto for that matter is to encourage global acceptance and to make it a useful coin to be bought and sold. Or... alternatively/in addition to, someone new needs to take the coin in a different direction. If e.g. doge was to become limited supply it would literally reach the moon. However this would make it another store of value similar to btc, and the potential to become a currency would be lost. Central banks are already making plans to get control of the crypto which will make that $1 even harder to reach, but with enough people anything is possible. A $10 price, as it stands today, is impossible, unless the whole doge ethos changes. \"Over to you Elon Musk\" lol 0.9663\n",
